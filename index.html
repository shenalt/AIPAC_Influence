        <h1 class="title">The Influence of AIPAC on NY State House Representatives</h1>
        <h2>The American Israel Public Affairs Committee contributed over $3 million to New York House races. That doesn't even include the amount given to George Latimer.</h2>

                The latest election cycle in New York House races was a frightening insight into money and politics in the country and who exerted their influence this go around. In 2024, 
                it wasn't just financial institutions that gave big to campaign coffers all across the street. The Israel lobby became a significant influence in House races, lending their 
                dollars to 19 different candidates who won their bid for Congress across the 26 seats available for New York in the House of Representatives.

                Analyzing data from OpenSecrets, more than $3 million was given to candidates who won, although the data is missing several candidates contribution information. The figure 
                does not include George Latimer who also receieved significant sums of money to help defeat incumbent Jamaal Bowman. Candidates also received a large amount of money from 
                NorPAC, another group apart of the Israel lobby.

                The onset of the genocide in Gaza saw pro-Zionist factions such as AIPAC spring into action, supporting candidates supportive of Israel and their litany of crimes against humanity, 
                specifically the people of Palestine. Unfortunately, the efforts seemed to have prevailed in removing some candidates who had the audacity to speak out against genocide. With 
                Trump's latest comments regarding the Gaza Strip, Israel seems to be well on the path of ethnic cleansing and resettlement of the Palestinian land.
